## My Metrics
An analytics service and reporting tool for Bloc Jams using the D3.js visualization library

### How it works
Metrics is an analytics tracker for the music player app that can track metrics such as song play count, a list of songs played, number of visits to each page, etc.

Metrics focuses on these important components:

* A client-side event handler that executes a callback when an arbitrary metric is recorded
* An Angular model to captures displayable events
* A new state accessible from the navigation that handles all of the operations on the analytics service
